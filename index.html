  <h2>Delicious Japanese Curry</h2>
  <p>
    This curry is as delicious as it is simple and you will never guess what the
    ingredient is that gives it that signature flavor.  HONEY!
  </p>
  <p>
    I shit you not, you can put anything you want in here.  Beef, pork, chicken.
    I'd even toss a racoon in if I could get my hands on one.  It's delicious no matter what.
